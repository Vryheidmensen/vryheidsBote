This is the repository for a nation roleplaying game, hosted on an application in the social messaging platform Discord.
As you can see, I'm new to programming, and have little experience with software development or GitHub itself. This project is made for fun and as practice for making complex projects.

This project began externally in 2017, and has been inactive since 2023. I hope to revive it sometime in the future.
